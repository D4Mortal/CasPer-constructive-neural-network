To run either Casper.py or Baseline.py you will the following packages:

Python 3.6, numpypy, torch, pandas, matplotlib

This is an implementation of the constructive algorithm Casper with RPROP trained on the SFEW dataset

Casper.py contains the implementations of a casper network and Baseline.py contains the implementation of a standard multi layer neural network. There are no additional arguements for execution, however the data file "SFEW_processed.xlsx" must be under the same directory to run

See the report for more details
